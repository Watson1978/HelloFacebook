# HelloFacebook : Facebook SDK sample for RubyMotion

This sample just ports https://github.com/facebook/facebook-ios-sdk/tree/master/samples/SessionLoginSample

## Requirements

- RubyMotion 1.34
- Facebook SDK for iOS v3.2

## Set up

1. Download [Facebook SDK for iOS](https://developers.facebook.com/ios/) and install it.
2. Remove ~/Documents/FacebookSDK/FacebookSDK.framework/Versions/A/Resources/Info.plist because it causes following error:
```
ERROR! Cannot use `/Users/watson/Documents/FacebookSDK/FacebookSDK.framework/Resources/Info.plist' as a resource file because it's a reserved application bundle file
```
